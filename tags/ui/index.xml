      <description>&lt;p&gt;Operation Exodus is an Abertay University project for module DES310 with the brief &amp;ldquo;One More Run&amp;rdquo; suggested by Modern Wolf.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Abandoning their ruined and infected planet Hydrox, the last remaining Hydroxan population fights to survive by escaping on a large Colonist ship.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With the assistance of a coalition of a few other races they set out to find a new planet away from the dangers of the symbiote infection.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, the symbiote developed enough intelligence from its time on the planet to find a way to sneak aboard the ship, eventually taking over and infecting most of the inhabitants.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are one of the last survivors, along with the other survivors in your hideout you struggle and strive to survive in this toxic environment. Made even more dangerous by the fact you cannot breathe the air and must rely on a dwindling stock of oxygen tanks to live.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is your job to go out and scavenge for supplies as you await rescue or the inevitable end.&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;carousel&#34; data-carousel&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;button class=&#34;carousel-btn prev&#34; type=&#34;button&#34;&gt;‹&lt;/button&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;div class=&#34;carousel-track&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://no1gobl.in/images/Operation_Exodus_6.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://no1gobl.in/images/Operation_Exodus_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://no1gobl.in/images/Operation_Exodus_3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://no1gobl.in/images/Operation_Exodus_4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://no1gobl.in/images/Operation_Exodus_5.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;video controls=&#34;&#34; class=&#34;active&#34; poster=&#34;images/Operation_Exodus_1.png&#34;&gt;&#xA;                        &lt;source src=&#34;https://no1gobl.in/videos/Operation_Exodus_Trailer.mp4&#34; type=&#34;video/mp4&#34;&gt;&#xA;                        Your browser does not support the video tag.&#xA;                    &lt;/video&gt;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;button class=&#34;carousel-btn next&#34; type=&#34;button&#34;&gt;›&lt;/button&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xA;My main responsibilities in this project were to create the weapon and item systems, along with the supply shop, upgrade shop, and item storage. This involved the creation of pipelines to allow designers to implement new items using a scriptable object system, along with a fully modular system for implementing weapon functionalities.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also implemented functionality for item pickups, along with the loot crates and enemy drops that would create them. In addition I implemented hotkey functionality to allow the player to bind useful items to a hotkey so that they can use them quickly in a pinch.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was also put in charge of programming almost all on-screen UI elements, including indicators for health, oxygen and weapon heat, alongside interactive UI for the item and upgrade shops, and also with the item storage box and associated interactions with the inventory.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Creation of and handling of bug reports was also one of my major responsibilities on this project, with me being in charge of ensuring builds were stable and bug-free before showcases, and implementing feedback received during showcases of the game in order to create more enjoyable experiences. I was also responsible for compiling builds for both PC and Xbox One before showcases and ensuring there were no bugs introduced between development and release builds.&#xA;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Operation Exodus was my first project developed in the Unity Engine, and was programmed in C#. We also took this project to Abertay University&amp;rsquo;s Dare Academy 2024, where we reached the semi-final stage.&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://squid-kid-studios.itch.io/operation-exodus&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Operation Exodus - Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/elin-rafferty/DES310-Project&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Operation Exodus - Github&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://no1gobl.in/images/Operation_Exodus_7.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
