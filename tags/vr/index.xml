      <description>&lt;p&gt;Stuck in a deadly maze with a friend stuck in a locked control room, you must communicate in order to escape. The unlabelled buttons in the control room could open doors vital for your escape or activate deadly traps that will certainly spell your doom. The only way to know for sure is to f!#&amp;amp;ck around and find (your way) out. A 2-player networked multiplayer game for Nintendo DS, PC and VR!&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;carousel&#34; data-carousel&gt;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;button class=&#34;carousel-btn prev&#34; type=&#34;button&#34;&gt;‹&lt;/button&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;div class=&#34;carousel-track&#34;&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    &#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://no1gobl.in/images/F_Around_2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://no1gobl.in/images/F_Around_3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://no1gobl.in/images/F_Around_4.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://no1gobl.in/images/F_Around_6.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;/div&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &lt;button class=&#34;carousel-btn next&#34; type=&#34;button&#34;&gt;›&lt;/button&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&lt;/div&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xA;When we came up with the concept for this game, with one person locked in a control room whilst the other navigates a deadly maze, I pitched the idea of the control panel being on a Nintendo DS instead of on PC, and the person navigating the maze using a VR headset. The image of two people playing a game together where one person was in VR and the other on a DS was enough to sell the team on the idea. The DS is a console I have very fond memories of, and I had been playing around with ideas for a homebrew DS game for a few months, and this was a great excuse to finally make it.&#xA;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://no1gobl.in/images/F_Around_7.png&#34;&#xA;    alt=&#34;Two players playing F!#&amp;amp;CK Around And Find (your way) Out, with one playing on DS and the other on a Steam Deck&#34;&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&#xA;      &lt;p&gt;Two players playing F!#&amp;amp;CK Around And Find (your way) Out, with one playing on DS and the other on a Steam Deck&lt;/p&gt;</description>
