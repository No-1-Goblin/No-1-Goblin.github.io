            <p>A collaborative team project between myself and fellow students for the DES310 module. Set on an overrun spaceship, Operation Exodus is a 2D top-down shooter created in the Unity Engine. My main contributions for this project were programming the mechanics for the player controller, weapon systems, the shop and upgrade systems, lootable crates, and item pickups.</p>

            </a>
            <p>A group project between myself and a friend for the CMP 208 module. Set on the space station of an evil robot army, you must travel through each level of the station, eliminating all hostiles on your way to the central server. This game was created using Abertay University's Games Educational Framework (GEF). My main contributions to this project were the weapon and projectile systems, the pickups, arcade mode, bug fixing of the procedural generation system, and optimisation of the model loading systems</p>
